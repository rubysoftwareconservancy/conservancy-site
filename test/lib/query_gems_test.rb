# TODO: close instance before we wrap for the day
=begin

Goal:
Have a means to add gems to be maintained by RSC


tell us what gems are high value and unmainted (archived)
this query could be cached? don't want to

Manual solution now:
* Look thru contacts, linkedin, github, rolodex
* Check ruby gems for that author
* Look at high download count (what's the trehshold for high, sort?)
* Pluck out some n number of gems
* check out their github projects for archived




ETL: Extract Transform and Load
grab a set of gems
query from a local copy

* [ ] this test is actually hitting the web, do we care about VCR type solutions?
      maybe we split the difference? how do our test suite protect us if the real api changes under us
